# Reach-Higher-Challenge

### Main Steps of the app

1. Compile a list of CTE programs available (get massive data for easy search and sortabiltiy)
2. Develop an algorithmic questionaire that takes interests and aligns them with potential career choices (some research needs to be done on this end)
3. Develop initial sketch flows of the app (lets make a mobile-first web app so that it can easily be accessed and bc im lazy and i'll use rails)
4. Figure out what information we need to track, and what information we can leverage via APIs
5. Build an MVP

### MVP Notes
Here is what i'm thinking.
The MVP is a mobile web application that shows a bunch of CTE programs based on different types of career paths in the technology industry.
It will illustrate:
- details about the program available, 
- details on where they can find said programs, 
- people to contact, 
- how much it will cost
- who has gone through the program
- any other big names in the said program
- how to get involved as a student

(Guess I can used CODE2040, Black Girls Code, Include Girls, Hack the Hood, and other programs as examples)
